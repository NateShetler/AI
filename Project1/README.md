# AI Project 1

This project will solve the 8 puzzle problem using basic artificial intelligence techniques. 

It can solve the problem either by being "informed" and using the hamming priority function to find the winning sequence of the puzzle 
or "uninformed" by guessing the next state in the sequence until the problem is solved. 

The project is in one file currently, but if worked on in the future, could and probably should be broken into multiple files.
