# AI Project 1

This project will solve the 8 puzzle problem using basic artificial intelligence techniques. 

The user inputs the initial state of the puzzle, as well as the goal state of the puzzle that the program will solve a sequence for. In some cases, there is no 
winning sequence and the user will be informed of this. 

States of the puzzle include numbers 1 - 8 and are in a 3 row by 3 column format. An example is as follows:

1 6 4 <br>
2 5 3 <br>
8 7   <br>

The project can solve the problem either by being "informed" and using the hamming priority function to find the winning sequence of the puzzle 
or "uninformed" by guessing the next state in the sequence until the problem is solved. The winning sequence of the puzzle will be outputted into the
8puzzlelog.txt file.

The project was written in python and the code is in one file currently, but if worked on in the future, could and probably should be broken into multiple files.
